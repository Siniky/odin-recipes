    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Apple pie is a classic dessert that features a flaky, buttery crust filled with sweet and spiced apple slices. The filling is typically made with a combination of tart and sweet apples, sugar, cinnamon, and sometimes nutmeg. The pie is baked until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Apple pie is often served warm, sometimes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream on top. It's a beloved treat that evokes feelings of comfort and nostalgia for many people.</p>    

    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ice water</li>
        <li>6 cups thinly sliced apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, tossing with a fork until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half, shape into disks, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg until well coated.</li>
        <li>Roll out one disk of dough on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Transfer the dough to the dish and trim any excess. Fill with the apple mixture.</li>
        <li>Roll out the second disk of dough and place it over the filling. Trim and crimp the edges to seal. Cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges start to brown too quickly, cover them with foil.</li>
        <li>Allow the pie to cool before serving. Enjoy!</li>
